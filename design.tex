This chapter describes all the steps that were taken in the design of a controller for the rolling mill plant. Along the way all the design choices will be explained and substantiated.

\section{Master motor}
The master motor is the one that pulls the strip and winds it up on a spool. The left motor was chosen as master since its RPM at working current is higher. \todo{ref to figure of RPM in function of current} This is necessary since when the strip is compressed to reduce its thickness it extends. The speed of the winding motor needs to be higher than the feeding motor.
